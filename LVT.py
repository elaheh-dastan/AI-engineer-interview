# Task 1: write a function to calculate the similarity (Dot Product) between two vectors.
# Task 2: Given a query vector and a list of product vectors, find the ID of the top k similar items.

# Example Data
query_vec = [0.1, 0.5, 0.2]

database = [
  {"id": 101, "vector": [0.1, 0.5, 0.2]},
  {"id": 102, "vector": [0.9, 0.1, 0.0]},
  {"id": 103, "vector": [0.2, 0.4, 0.2]},
]
